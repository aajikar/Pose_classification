# Pose Classification

The repo is organized in sections. The main code right now runs a training on the bodies at rest data with three labelled classes supine, lateral, and prone. 

## TODO

Project constants file with all the paths and directories

Changing the dataset to have the 8 original labels found in bodies at rest

Preprocessing to account for imbalance data

Split the training randomly into validation data set by physically moving the files

Make the training more modular by allowing # of layers, type of layers to be defined

Classes for different datasets that will be used
